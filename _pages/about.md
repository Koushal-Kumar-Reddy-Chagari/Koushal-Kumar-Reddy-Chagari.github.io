Hi! 

I am Koushal, a final-year undergraduate in the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras. I am passionate about wireless communication, networking, and sensing. I aim to pursue a Ph.D at a prestigious university in the United States. I desire to work in industrial R&D after grad school.
